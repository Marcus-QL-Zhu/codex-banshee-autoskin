name: codex-autoskin
version: 2.3.0
description: Apply, launch, verify, theme-switch, repair, update, or restore a full decorative skin for the Windows Codex desktop app. Use when the user asks for a Codex theme beyond official color settings, wants a custom image turned into a skin theme, needs the skin reapplied after a Codex update, or needs a safe rollback without modifying WindowsApps or app.asar.

# Codex AutoSkin

Apply a reversible renderer skin through Chromium DevTools Protocol while launching the official Store-installed Codex executable. Never replace or take ownership of files under `WindowsApps`.

Themes are data, not code: the injector scans `themes/` and `themes-private/` for folders containing `theme.json` (meta + 28 required tokens + art, plus optional `cards`/`stickers`/`composer` decor fields — including v1.2 `cards.icons` built-in badge icons) and generates the payload at start. To create or adjust a theme, follow `THEME-SPEC.md` at the repo root — never hardcode theme names into engine files.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the host is Windows 10/11 with the Microsoft Store `OpenAI.Codex` package, Windows PowerShell 5.1, and enough free space for the verified per-user runtime. No administrator shell or separate Node.js installation is required: lifecycle scripts use the bundled Node copied from the trusted Store Codex payload and verify its hash. Contributors who execute JavaScript source tools directly need Node.js 22.4 or newer.
2. Run the repository-root `Install.cmd` once. It delegates to `scripts/install-dream-skin.ps1`, sets the matching official dark base colors, creates launch/restore shortcuts, and installs the hidden auto-recovery watcher. Use the PowerShell installer directly with `-NoAutoRecover` only when the user explicitly does not want normal Codex restarts intercepted.
3. Open Codex normally and allow the watcher to recover the skin, or run `scripts/start-dream-skin.ps1` for an explicit launch. Add `-RestartExisting` only when the user authorized restarting an already-open Codex app.
4. Run `scripts/verify-dream-skin.ps1 -ScreenshotPath <absolute-path>` after launch. Treat a missing hero, native composer, sidebar skin, or injection marker as failure. The native suggestion count is responsive and may be two to four.
5. Switch themes/layouts programmatically with `scripts/set-theme.ps1 <theme> [banner|fullscreen]` (or `--list`); the wrapper locates the verified bundled Node. A contributor may run `node scripts/set-theme.mjs ...` with a system Node.js 22.4+ installation. There is intentionally no on-screen switch UI; the choice persists via localStorage and survives reloads and watcher-recovered restarts.
6. Inspect the screenshot against `references/qa-inventory.md`. Verify every scanned theme in both home layouts before signing off; `node scripts/injector.mjs --themes` lists what was scanned.
7. Run `scripts/restore-dream-skin.ps1` for live removal. Add `-Uninstall` to delete shortcuts; add `-RestoreBaseTheme` when the user also wants the pre-install config backup restored.

## Guardrails

- Preserve the official executable, package signature, user threads, pets, plugins, and authentication state.
- Do not use a reference screenshot as a fake whole-window control overlay. Theme art may only supply a cropped banner, a fullscreen home canvas, a low-contrast chat-art layer, or a decorative polaroid; all controls remain live Codex controls.
- Preserve the two independent home layouts: `banner` keeps the hero on top, while `fullscreen` turns the hero crop into the home canvas. Both keep native suggestions centered and the native project selector/composer at the bottom.
- Themes come exclusively from the manifest scan. Each theme owns separate home-art and chat-art roles, crop tokens, wash strength, copy, and accents in its `theme.json`; per-theme CSS exceptions live in that theme's `extra.css`, which must stay scoped to `html.dream-theme-<name>` (the injector rejects unscoped files).
- Keep chat art faint and subject-focused. It must never reduce message contrast or expose readable fake controls/text from a source screenshot.
- When replacing a theme image, keep geometry unchanged and adjust only that theme's crop/overlay/wash tokens in its `theme.json`.
- Attach the "选择项目" treatment to Codex's real project-selector toolbar and keep the current project button clickable; never draw a disconnected replacement.
- Keep decorative layers `pointer-events: none`. The decorative chrome container stays at a low z-index so real Codex modals cover it.
- Stickers (speech bubble, promo board, corner rose) are strictly opt-in per theme, render fullscreen-home-only inside the chrome layer, and must never overlap a native control. The sidebar "new task" capsule is a marker class on the real native button; the account/profile button is only restyled, never covered or replaced by a fake identity card. The theme composer placeholder rides a CSS var fallback, so restore automatically brings the native text back.
- Inject only the main `app://-/index.html` renderer. Never inject into compact/auxiliary renderers such as `initialRoute=/avatar-overlay`; those windows must retain a fully transparent body for desktop pets.
- On app updates, let the watcher verify and refresh the per-user runtime. If recovery fails, inspect `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CodexDreamSkin\watcher.log` before manually rerunning install and launch.
- Never assume port `9335`. Installation allocates and persists an available loopback port; use the persisted port or pass the same explicit port consistently to start, verify, set-theme, and restore.
- Keep the injection daemon running for navigation/reload resilience. Its state and logs live under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CodexDreamSkin`.
- Keep the single-instance auto-recovery watcher enabled when restart persistence is expected. It waits for a normally launched Codex window, allows startup grace, then safely relaunches Codex with loopback CDP and the injector. It must remain idle while Codex is closed.

## Resources

- `Install.cmd`: human-friendly Windows entry point; delegates to the PowerShell installer without duplicating lifecycle logic.
- `THEME-SPEC.md`: agent-facing spec for authoring themes (schema, 28 tokens, crop workflow, clean-art vs UI-screenshot decision tree, acceptance checklist).
- `scripts/injector.mjs`: theme scanning/validation, payload generation, CDP injection, auxiliary-window transparency protection, verification (`--verify`), theme report (`--themes`), screenshot, and removal.
- `scripts/set-theme.ps1`: user-facing theme/layout switcher that locates the verified bundled Node.
- `scripts/set-theme.mjs`: developer-facing JavaScript implementation of programmatic theme/layout switching against the running instance.
- `scripts/watch-dream-skin.ps1`: hidden single-instance watcher that restores the skin after an ordinary Codex restart and repairs a missing injector.
- `styles/dream/style.css`: structure layer; consumes tokens only, contains no theme names.
- `assets/renderer-inject.js`: idempotent DOM integration and cleanup; fully manifest-driven.
- `themes/<name>/`, `themes-private/<name>/`: theme data folders (`theme.json`, art, optional `extra.css`). `themes-private/` is git-ignored for local-only themes.
- `tools/generate-demo-art.py`: reproducible generator for the bundled demo art.
- `references/qa-inventory.md`: required functional and visual signoff coverage.
- `references/runtime-notes.md`: troubleshooting and update behavior.
- `references/scene-art-swap.md`: worked example of swapping a theme's art for a full-canvas scene image (THEME-SPEC §5.1 preset) with the live-tuning workflow and final tokens.
